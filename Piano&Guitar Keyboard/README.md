In this project, we design a Piano&Guitar keyboard GUI use Python. Specifically, we use a difference equation to simulate the piano sound, and Karplus-Strong system to simulate the guitar voice. We can use keyboard and mouse to play different notes of piano and guitar. The notes can be played overlappingly. The output signal is written to the output audio device (loudspeaker/headphones). For intuition, we plot the output signal in real-time.
