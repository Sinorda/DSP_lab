# Digital Signal Processing Lab
This module is about real-time implementation of algorithms for digital signal processing (DSP) with an emphasis on audio processing.
Includes topics of:

1. Audio input-output and buffering. 

2. Filtering (recursive and non-recursive filters, structures). 

3. Fast Fourier transform and windowed spectral analysis. 

4. Digital audio effects (delay line, amplitude modulation, reverberation, distortion, phase vocoder). 

5. Time-varying and adaptive filters.

You are going to implement these algorithms for real-time audio processing in software (e.g., Matlab and Python).
